This is the "E-Bike Memory Seat" project repository. The seperate modules of the project are combined inside a catkin workspace. The main modules are the web client, ROS server and microcontroller.

Credit where credit is due, making this project would not have been possible without the help of these tutorials:
- Example C SocketCAN Code by Craig Peacock, https://www.beyondlogic.org/example-c-socketcan-code/
- CAN recieve tutorial by loovee, 2014-6-13, for the Arduino.
- ROS tutorials, http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
